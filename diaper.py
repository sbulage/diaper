"""
Diaper pattern
==============

Returns:
    Result of the function call if no exception is raised.
    Otherwise it returns None.

Usage::

    import diaper

    # call it directly
    diaper(function, *function_args, **function_kwargs)

    # as a context manager
    with diaper:
        do_terrible_things_here()

    # see if the diaper caught anything:
    with diaper:
        raise Exception
    assert diaper.smelly

    # diapers are automatically changed on use
    with diaper:
        pass
    assert not diaper.smelly

    # diapers can be manually changed and (somehow) soiled
    diaper.soil()
    assert diaper.smelly

    diaper.change()
    assert not diaper.smelly

    # diapers can be manipulated in the context with `as`
    with diaper as nappy:
        # But, of course, this serves no useful purpose
        # Since you can just as easily manipulate diaper
        assert nappy is diaper
        if something_smells_funny:
            nappy.soil()
    assert diaper.smelly and nappy.smelly

Note:

    diapers are thread-safe
